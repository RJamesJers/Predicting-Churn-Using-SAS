# Predictive Analytics Assignment 2
Using SAS Enterprise Miner to predict which Employee's are Valuable and which are likely to Churn (Leave their role).

It was found that the best variables to indicate "Employee Value" were “JobInvolvement” and “PerformanceRating”.

### Key Findings

The company should focus on its youngest employees as they are the most valuable, but also the most likely to leave the company. Part of the reason for this is the increased number of workers who are working overtime; we believe that these workers feel undervalued and that is the primary reason they are leaving.

To combat the Churn, we propose that the company do the following: Offer quick promotions to Junior members of staff, offer pay rises alongside promotions and hire more workers to reduce the number of employees working overtime.

It was found that the most effective model for this case was a Decision Tree, however the Neural Network model also gave solid performance.
